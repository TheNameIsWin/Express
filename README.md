I am creating notes that will help me study Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

For Express, I am starting by creating a fresh project.
In this project, the first thing I use is package.json.

The package.json file helps me:

Manage all project dependencies

See which packages are used in the project

Define commands (scripts) to run the project

Before doing anything else, I need to create the package.json file.

For that, I use this command:

npm init -y


This command creates the package.json file automatically in my project.

After that, I install the required packages:

npm install express
npm install nodemon


Express is used to create the server and handle routes.


Nodemon automatically restarts the server whenever the code changes


Nodemon automatically restarts the server whenever the code changes.
